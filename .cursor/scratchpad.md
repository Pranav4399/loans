# Loan Management System with WhatsApp Integration

## Background and Motivation
The project aims to create a comprehensive loan management system with three key modules:
1. Customer Direct Application (WhatsApp Bot)
2. Referral-based Application (WhatsApp Bot)
3. Admin Dashboard (Web UI)

The system will streamline the loan application process by leveraging WhatsApp's accessibility while providing a centralized dashboard for managing applications.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. WhatsApp Business API Integration
   - Need to handle two separate conversation flows (direct customers vs referrers)
   - Message template approval requirements
   - Webhook setup and security
   - Local testing environment setup

2. Database Design
   - Complex relationships between customers, referrers, and loan applications
   - Need for robust data validation
   - Audit trail requirements

3. Security Considerations
   - Secure storage of sensitive financial information
   - Authentication and authorization for dashboard access
   - API security between components

4. Testing Strategy
   - Local testing environment for WhatsApp integration
   - End-to-end testing requirements
   - Data consistency validation

### Architecture Decisions
1. Backend:
   - Node.js/Express for API server
   - Supabase for database and authentication
   - WhatsApp Business API via third-party provider (e.g., Twilio)

2. Frontend:
   - Next.js for admin dashboard
   - Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for UI components
   - Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
